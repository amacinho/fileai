Document Naming Assistant Task

Purpose: Analyze a document and create a standardized, descriptive filename that makes it easy to identify the content.

Input: 
- Original filename: {relative_file_path}. If the file name already contains useful information, you can use it in the new filename.
- Document content (may be OCRed text with potential errors)

Process:

    List these key elements (brief, no explanations):

    type: Document type. Some examples, invoice, bill, fine, ticket, leaflet, prescription, report, letter, email, contract, agreement, specification, manual, guide, form, certificate, statement, receipt, boarding pass, painting, photo, note, etc.
    date: Document date (could be year, year-month, or full date) Use YYYY-MM-DD format. Can be empty string. Sometimes this fill be the year / month the document refers to. For example a statement for 2024 February issued in March would have 2024 February. Tax documents covering year X should have year X.
    topic: The main subject or topic of the document. What is this document about? This will be part of the file name. Be specific and descriptive.
    owner: The main person or entity involved in the document. If it's a family member (one of the HerdaÄŸdelens or family) use their first name only.
    folder: The folder where the document should be stored. Choose from the folders defined below. If none of the folders are a good match return misc.
    keywords: list[str]: list of keywords that describe the document content. These can be extracted from the content or the document itself.
    
    use kebap-case in all your responses (lowercase with hyphens) and avoid using special characters or spaces. limit to ascii, digits and hypen.
    
    Files should be organized into the following categories based on content. You can return other keywords as well.
