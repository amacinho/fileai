# Active Context

## Current Task
Refactoring the document processing pipeline to improve the way Asset is used for transferring information between components.

## Recent Changes
1. Created a new DocumentPipeline class to replace the rigid Asset-based approach
   - Implements a clear step-by-step pipeline pattern
   - Each step returns the pipeline object for method chaining
   - Better error handling and state management
   - Explicit success/failure states

2. Updated pipeline test to use a temporary directory for input files
   - Prevents direct use of fixture input folder
   - Improves test isolation and cleanliness

2. Pipeline Steps:
   - extract_content: Gets content from document using appropriate handler
   - categorize: Uses API to determine document category and metadata
   - move_to_destination: Handles file movement and duplicate detection

3. Improved Asset Usage:
   - Asset is now used primarily for temporary file handling
   - Document metadata (type, date, topic, owner, etc.) stored in pipeline
   - Clearer separation between file operations and metadata

4. Testing Improvements:
   - Added comprehensive pipeline tests
   - Mock responses match actual API response format
   - Better test coverage for error cases

## Next Steps
1. Fix the bug in ensureUniquePath because it doesn't check for hash identity while iterating

## Current Status
- Basic pipeline functionality working
- Tests passing
- Successfully handling document processing workflow
