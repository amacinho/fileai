# Technical Context

## Architecture Overview
The system uses a pipeline-based architecture for document processing:

1. Document Pipeline
   - Core processing logic
   - Step-by-step document handling
   - State management
   - Error handling

2. Asset Management
   - Temporary file handling
   - File type detection
   - MIME type management

3. Document Handlers
   - File type specific processing
   - Content extraction
   - Format conversion

4. API Integration
   - LLM provider integration
   - Document categorization
   - Metadata extraction

## Technologies Used

### Core System
- Python 3.12+
- pathlib for file operations
- logging for error tracking

### Document Processing
- pdfplumber for PDF handling
- python-docx for Word documents
- Pillow for image processing
- pandas for spreadsheet handling

### API Integration
- Gemini API for document analysis
- Rate limiting for API calls
- JSON for response handling

### Testing
- pytest for unit testing
- unittest.mock for mocking
- Test fixtures for file operations

## Development Setup
1. Python virtual environment
2. Required dependencies from requirements.txt
3. API keys configured in .env or config file
4. Test fixtures in tests/fixtures/

## Technical Constraints
1. File Operations
   - Must handle large files efficiently
   - Need to manage temporary files
   - Must handle concurrent access

2. API Usage
   - Rate limiting requirements
   - Response format standardization
   - Error handling for API failures

3. Document Processing
   - Memory efficient processing
   - Support for multiple file formats
   - Proper cleanup of temporary files

4. Testing
   - Mock responses for API calls
   - Test fixtures for file operations
   - Coverage for error cases

## Performance Considerations
1. File Processing
   - Efficient content extraction
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Memory management

2. API Calls
   - Rate limiting
   - Response caching
   - Error recovery

3. Pipeline Operations
   - Step isolation
   - State management
   - Error containment

## Security Considerations
1. File Access
   - Safe file operations
   - Permission management
   - Path validation

2. API Security
   - Key management
   - Secure communication
   - Response validation

3. Data Protection
   - Temporary file cleanup
   - Secure file storage
   - Access control
